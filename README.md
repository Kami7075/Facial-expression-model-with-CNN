Facial Expression Model with CNN

Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into categories such as happy, sad, angry, and surprised. The model provides a robust way to detect emotional cues from facial images, useful in applications like human-computer interaction and social robotics.

Dataset
Dataset: Facial expression images labeled by emotion.
Objective: Train a CNN model to accurately classify images by emotion.
Key Features
Model Architecture: Multiple convolutional and pooling layers with fully connected layers for classification.
Image Preprocessing: Resized and normalized images for optimal model performance.
Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy and loss used to fine-tune the model.
Requirements
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Run facial-emotion-expressions-cnn.ipynb to train and evaluate the model.
